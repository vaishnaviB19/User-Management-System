# User-Management-System
This is a basic User Management Web App built with Node.js, Express, MySQL, and EJS. It demonstrates fundamental CRUD operations (Read, Update) integrated with a relational database and dynamic rendering using EJS templates. The application leverages faker.js to populate the database with 100 randomly generated users for development and testing.
